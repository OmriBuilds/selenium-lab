# Selenium Lab

This is a beginner-friendly automation testing sandbox where I practice writing Selenium scripts in Python.

## What’s inside

- `selenium_test.py`: Opens Google and waits for user to manually close it
- `selenium_test2.py`: Opens Google, waits 3 seconds, then closes automatically
- `.gitignore`: Cleans up junk files like `__pycache__`
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages needed to run the tests

## How to run

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed. Then:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python selenium_test.py
